# matplotlib-challenge
This assignment used new tools such as matplotlib, scipy, and numpy to create charts and plots to analyze the reults of the mice in an  experiment with the different drug regimes in reaction to the tumor. From the charts, it was observed that mice used more of capomulin and ramicane regimens and that there was almost more male than female in the experiment. Also, in the box plot, it shows that the tumor volume size for the capomulin and remicane drugs were smaller than the others such as infubinol and ceftamn. Line and scatter plot were used to mainly focus on Capomuling regimen on a specific mouse. The results showed that the tumor is not progressing as the same as the weight of the mouse with the capomulin drug regimen.
